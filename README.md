# ðŸŒ±ðŸŒµ WATER ME!ðŸŒµðŸŒ±

## This project will be a dashboard for your plants to remind you who needs to be watered. No plant left behind. 

** You can add plants to the data structure with the .addPlant prototype on the Plant Controller. 

```javascript
PlantController.addPlant: function (name, amtWat, freqWat)
```
** The testing prototype will log the data object to the console. 

```javascript
PlantController.testing()
```

This is a work in progress, so any feedback would be much appreciated. 

THANKS!!
